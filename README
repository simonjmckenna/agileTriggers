The agileTriggers application is made up of 3 key components both driven 
via Crontab. 

The agileTriggers component uses REST API calls to get data from Octopus energy
about forward pricing for it's Agile Tarriff.  This data is stored in a 
Sqlite database The pricing component is updated daily, the program runs under 
crontab to  get the data.

The getUsage component runs again daily to load into the same database table 
generated by agileTriggers historic usage of a specific meter in the time 
slots loaded. 

The checktriggers component runs every half hour on the hour and half hour as 
driven by crontab. The list of triggers is stored in the same database as 
agileTriggers & getUsage. The triggers are managed via the triggers utility.
